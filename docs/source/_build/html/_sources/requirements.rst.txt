Requirements
============

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   :caption: Contents:

The `Pipeliner` framework requires `Nextflow` and `Anaconda`. `Nextflow` can be used on any POSIX compatible system (Linux, OS X, etc). It requires BASH and `Java 8 (or higher) <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_ to be installed. Third-party software tools used by individual pipelines will be installed and managed through a Conda virtual environment.

Testing Nextflow
----------------
Before continuuing, test to make sure your environment is compatible with a Nextflow executable. 

.. note:: You will download another one later when you clone the repository

Make sure your Java installation is version 8 or higher::

   java -version

Create a new directory and install/test `Nextflow`::

   mkdir nf-test
   cd nf-test
   curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
   ./nextflow run hello

Output::

   N E X T F L O W  ~  version 0.31.0

   [ee/0d879f] Submitted process > sayHello (1)
   Hola world!
   Ciao world!
   Hello world!
   Bonjour world!

Installing Anaconda
-------------------

Pipeliner uses virtual environments managed by `Conda`, which is available through `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Download the distribution pre-packaged with Python 2.7. 

Make sure conda is installed and updated::

   conda --version
   conda update conda

.. tip:: If this is your first time working with `Conda`, you may need to edit your configuration paths to ensure `Anaconda` is invoked when calling ``conda``


Pre-Packaged Conda Environment
------------------------------

Anaconda Cloud
``````````````

`Environment for both Linux and OS X`::
   
   conda create -n pipeliner python=2.7
   source activate pipeliner
   conda install --channel "pipeliner" \
   trim-galore fastqc star multiqc samtools rseqc stringtie \
   hisat2 htseq subread numpy pandas bioconductor-biobase

Yaml File
`````````

`Environment for Linux`::

   conda env create -f pipeliner/envs/linux_env.yml

`Environment for OS X`::

   conda env create -f pipeliner/envs/osx_env.yml

Setting up Pipeliner
--------------------

With all prerequisites, one can quickly setup Pipeliner by cloning the repository, configuring local paths to toy datasets, activating the conda environment, and downloading the Nextflow executable::

   # Activate conda environment
   source activate pipeliner

   # Clone Pipeliner
   git clone https://github.com/montilab/pipeliner

   # Configure local paths to toy datasets
   python pipeliner/scripts/paths.py

   # Move to pipelines directory
   cd pipeliner/pipelines

   # Download nextflow executable
   curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

   # Run RNA-seq pipeline with toy data
   ./nextflow rnaseq.nf -c rnaseq.config

The output should look like this::

   N E X T F L O W  ~  version 0.31.1
